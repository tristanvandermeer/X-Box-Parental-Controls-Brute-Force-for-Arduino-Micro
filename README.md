# X-Box-Parental-Controls-Brute-Force-for-Arduino-Micro

Included in the repo is the .ino file. 

[ATTENTION]: You may not need the following boards manager. I don't think X-Input works anymore. I'll need to double check.

# Out of date

You'll need this Additional boards manager URL in the Aruduino IDE:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmadison/ArduinoXInput_Boards/master/package_dmadison_xinput_index.json

Brute force begins as soon as the Arduino Micro is plugged in.
